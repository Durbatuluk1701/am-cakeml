# Tests

This folder contains some tests and demo scripts to run.

[Manifest Demo](./manifest_demo.sh)

- First make sure you have a `build` folder and have run `cmake ..` within it
- Ensure `tmux` is installed
- Next run `./manifest_demo.sh`
- To close this afterwards, make sure you close all `tmux` panes using `PREFIX + x` where the prefix is typically (Ctrl + b)
  (To kill all tmux panes at once, type 'tmux kill-server' in one of the open panes)
